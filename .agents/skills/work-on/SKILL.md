# Work On

Take one ticket from the frontier and drive it all the way to an open pull request: isolate the work in its own worktree, build it test-first, commit it, and raise the PR. One ticket, one fresh session - the unit [[to-tickets]] cut the plan into.

This skill dispatches a ticket; it does not decide what to build. The deciding happened upstream in [[refine]], the recording in [[to-spec]], the slicing in [[to-tickets]]. Do not reopen any of it. If the ticket is ambiguous enough that you would have to invent a decision, stop and send the user back to [[refine]] rather than guessing here.

## Pick a frontier ticket - never a spec

Work only from a **ticket**, and only one on the **frontier** - status `ready-for-agent` or `ready-for-human`, and every ticket it is blocked by is `done`. A ticket is the sole unit this skill builds from.

**Never build directly off a spec.** A spec is not a build target - agents and humans build only from tickets ([[to-tickets]] is emphatic about this). If the user points you at a spec, or at a spec that has no tickets yet, stop and send them to [[to-tickets]] to slice it first; do not start building. Likewise refuse a ticket whose status is neither `ready-for-agent` nor `ready-for-human` (a `done` ticket, or one still blocked): say why and stop.

Take the ticket the user names; if they name one that is still blocked, say which blockers are open and stop. If they name none, resolve the tracker and surface the frontier for them to pick from - do not grab one silently.

Resolve the tracker from `.tracker.toml` at the project root (see [[tracker-config]]): `local` tickets live under `docs/specs/NNNN-slug/`, `github` tickets are issues found via `gh issue list`. If the file is missing or malformed, hand off to [[tracker-config]] rather than guessing where work is tracked.

## The recipe

Run these in order. Each step is its own skill; drive them, do not reimplement them. Each `[[name]]` here is another skill: when a step hands work to one, load that skill and follow its instructions in full before doing the step. Never do the step from the summary here; it says only what this recipe adds.

1. **Read the ticket - and its parent spec.** Read the whole ticket: what it delivers, its blocking edges, whether it is `ready-for-agent` or `ready-for-human`. Then read its parent spec for the two things the ticket leans on but does not repeat: the **agreed seams** and the **out-of-scope** section. Building something the spec explicitly refused is a defect, not initiative. Ground yourself in how the code actually works and speak its language - read `docs/CONTEXT.md` for vocabulary and respect the ADRs in the area you are touching (see [[decision-context]]). ADRs are read-only here: build to them, never edit them. If the ticket cannot be built without contradicting an accepted ADR, or the build reveals that one is wrong, that is a new decision - stop and send the user back to [[refine]] rather than touching the ADR.

   If the ticket is `ready-for-human`, it reached the frontier because it turns on a call an agent should not make alone, a manual or external step, or a change too risky to hand off. Do not build it unattended - surface why it is human-flagged and confirm with the user before going further.

2. **Isolate the work.** Create a dedicated worktree with [[git-worktree]], branched off up-to-date default, so the work never lands on the user's current checkout or on stale state. All subsequent edits, tests, and commits happen there.

3. **Build it test-first.** Implement the ticket through [[tdd]]. The seams it needs agreed are the ones the parent spec settled; if the spec left them open, settle them with the user before any test. Report the final full-suite run.

4. **Run the repo's mechanical checks.** Before committing, run the project's formatter, linter, and type-checker - however this repo runs them (a Makefile target, a package script, `pre-commit`, the CI lint step) - and get them clean, applying autofixes where offered and fixing the rest by hand. This is the work-on agent's own job, not the reviewers': the two reviews are freed to spend their judgement on design, standards, spec, and security, and [[code-review]] can honestly skip what tooling enforces because that ground is already clean. If a check surfaces a pre-existing failure unrelated to this ticket, fix it too where it is cheap and say so; if it is not cheap, note it rather than leaving it silent.

5. **Commit the reviewable checkpoint.** With the suite green and the checks clean, record the work with [[git-committing]] on the worktree's branch. Do not push. Committing first is what gives the reviews a diff to run against: an immutable ref measured against the branch base, not a mutating working tree.

6. **Review - on the committed diff.** Put the finished change through two independent reviews, run in **separate sub-agents launched in one message** so they go concurrently in isolated contexts, each with fresh eyes on code this session is biased toward: [[code-review]] for standards and spec conformance, and [[security-review]] for vulnerabilities. Each runs as a single sub-agent reporting back here; [[code-review]] folds its own Standards and Spec axes into inline passes rather than spawning them further, since it is nested (its step 4 covers this). Run both against the **branch base** - the worktree branch measured against the up-to-date default it was branched from - and pass that base to each sub-agent as the explicit fixed point, so neither has to ask. Pin the other end too: pass the head as the exact commit SHA (`git rev-parse HEAD` at launch), never a bare `HEAD`. Each review states the range it covered on its first line; record that SHA against the review's result, because step 7 checks it. Both are strictly read-only. Collect both reports, then triage as the orchestrator - and treat this as a **loop, not a single pass**, the way a human change goes back to its reviewers until they sign off:

- Fix real findings by going back through a fresh [[tdd]] cycle - not a patch that skips the loop - landing each fix as its own follow-up commit.
- For a finding you judge not worth acting on, say which and why - do not silently drop it.
- Then hand the updated diff back for another pass. Scope the re-review to **what the fix commits changed, not to which review raised the finding**: every review whose domain those new commits could touch runs again. A fix is new code, and new code carries new risk - so a fix made for a [[code-review]] finding still gets a fresh [[security-review]], because the change you just wrote could introduce a vulnerability the earlier clean pass never saw. A review may skip re-running only when the new commits provably cannot reach its domain (for example, a docs-only or comment-only follow-up needs no security re-review); a clean prior result is never on its own a reason to skip. When unsure, re-run it.

Repeat until every review comes back clean - no actionable findings left beyond the ones you have explicitly and defensibly set aside. Keep the loop honest: if a reviewer keeps flagging the same thing and you keep declining it, stop and surface the disagreement to the user rather than spinning.

7. **Open the PR - only once every review covers the head.** Before opening it, run `git rev-parse HEAD` and check each review in turn. A review covers the head when its last clean pass was at exactly that SHA, or when every commit after that pass provably cannot reach the review's domain, by the same test step 6 uses, and you can name each such commit and why. If any review does not cover the head, go back to step 6 - do not open the PR. This is the check that catches a fix commit landing after the last review: a fix is new code, and an unreviewed fix is an unreviewed change.

   Raise the pull request with [[git-pr]], using its description format as it stands: its sections, its headings, and nothing of your own. Fill its `## Reviews` section from step 6, and on `github` put `Closes #N` for the originating ticket in its `## Notes` section, so merging the PR closes the ticket.

8. **Wait for the required checks - and fix what goes red.** The PR is not finished when it opens: the repo's CI is the run that covers what this machine could not, such as tests that need hardware or a platform it lacks. Watch the PR's required status checks until they settle (`gh pr checks --watch --required`). If the repo has no required checks, there is nothing to wait for. When a check fails, read its log, then fix the cause the same way step 6 fixes a finding: a fresh [[tdd]] cycle, a follow-up commit, and a re-review of what the fix changed, scoped by step 6's rule. Then push, update the PR's `## Reviews` section so it still covers the new head by step 7's test, and watch again, until every required check is green. If the checks cannot be read at all - a token without access to them, say - say so in the report rather than claiming they passed.

## What this skill does not do

- **It does not mark the ticket done.** The ticket closes when its PR is *merged*, not when the PR is opened - on `github` the `Closes #N` link does this automatically on merge. Do not flip ticket status here.
- **It does not change ADRs.** Not their body, not their status. Superseding or deprecating a decision is a decision, and decisions are made in [[refine]].
- **It does not work more than one ticket.** If finishing this ticket clears blockers and opens new frontier tickets, that is the next dispatch - a fresh session, a fresh run of this skill - not more work piled onto this one.

## Completion

Done when the ticket's behaviour is built and committed in its own worktree branch, the repo's format/lint/type checks are clean, both reviews have run on that committed diff and been driven to sign-off through the review-fix-re-review loop, each covering the PR's head as step 7 checks - review fixes landed as follow-up commits, and nothing actionable is left beyond findings explicitly set aside with reasons - the full suite is green on a real run, the PR is open and linked to the ticket, and its required checks are green. Report the worktree path, the branch, the final test run, the check results, the required checks' final state, how the review findings were handled with each review's last clean SHA, and the PR URL. Then stop: the ticket is not yours to close, and the next ticket is not yours to start.
